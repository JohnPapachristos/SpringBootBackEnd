###  SPRING BOOT CODE FOR BACK END 

  ## --> This is a first try creating a project with Java Spring boot!
  
  ## --> It does some simple thinks in the table like:
   * CREATE a User, 
   * DELETE a User by his id, 
   * UPDATE a User, 
   * GET a User by his id or name or email, or get all Users that are in the table.
    
  ## --> It also has testing with an embeded database table
  
  ## --> An extra feature is that there is code for hashing your password before putting it in the table (with MD5)
   * If you want to check the password for a login, hash the given password with the same way and compare the results!
