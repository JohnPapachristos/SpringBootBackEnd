### Spring Boot code for back end

  ## --> This is my first try creating a project with Java Spring boot
  
  ## --> It does some simple thinks for example:
   * create, 
   * delete, 
   * update, 
   * get
    
  ## --> It also has testing code with an embeded database table
  
  ## --> And code for hashing the added password in the table (with MD5)
